<b>DO NOT DM ME ASKING WHY THE WINDOW CLOSES INSTANTLY WHEN YOU DOUBLE CLICK IT,

DISCORD-EXPLOITS IS A COMMAND-LINE UTILITY MEANING YOU HAVE TO USE IT FROM A TERMINAL

IF THE PROGRAM SHOWS AN ERROR, READ THE ERROR BEFORE MESSAGING ME</b>

## Getting Started

`discord-exploits -h` will show you what commands can be used and what you have to do

## Usage

`discord-exploits -m <mode> -i <input file> [-q]`

| Mode | Description  |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| `c`  | Create a file that will crash most Discord desktop clients when played to the end |
|  `r` | Create a file that will instantly restart most Discord desktop clients when played to the end |
|  `v` | Create a virus image (upon sending to a channel, it will trigger antivirus software for anyone who sees it) |
|  `e` | Create a video which has an expanding video duration (00:00/00:02, 00:01/00:03, etc...) |
|  `n` | Create a video with negative duration |
|  `0` or `z` | Create a video with a removed duration header (0 second video) |
| `t` | Create a file that will play a different audio when it is replayed (still experimental) |

The program only supports `webm` files for video, `png` files for images and `ogg` files for audio (`t`)

##### The file will be saved with a random file name in the directory in which you ran the command

##### You can use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert a video to .webm or to convert an image to png (better than online converters)

##### The "virus" image may get flagged by windows defender and will get removed. to restore the file, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat protection and restore the file

## Installation

### Via releases

go to [the releases page](https://github.com/Schmenn/discord-exploits/releases) and download either the windows or linux version. the program is compatible with:

`windows-64-bit windows-32-bit`

`linux-64-bit linux-32-bit` (untested on linux)

### Compile from source

make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) installed and in your path

1. Clone this repository:  `git clone https://github.com/Schmenn/discord-exploits` (If you don't have git installed, install it [here](https://git-scm.com) or download the code as a zip)
2. Go into the folder: `cd discord-exploits`
3. Build it: `go build`

## Features

### Current Features
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will seem like infinite, because the duration keeps getting longer
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will look like it has got a huge negative duration
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will look like it has got a constant duration of 0
* Feature for creating an image then triggers other users' windows defender after being cached
* Feature for creating an audio file that plays a different track when you replay it ([always requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on a discord client, will crash it ([always requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))
* Transcoding from `mp4` to `webm`, from `jpeg` and `jpg` to `png` and from `mp4` and `m4a` to `ogg` ([requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))

## Disclaimer

The t/twice mode requires ffmpeg with all compatible file formats, even `ogg`, because the current version of the exploit has to convert the audio to a sample rate of 44100.

The c/crash mode also requires ffmpeg will all compatible file formats, because the input file needs to be concatenated with another file.
